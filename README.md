Is there any genetic similarity between genes of the electric eel fish (Electrophorus electricus), the european eel (Anguilla anguilla) and platypi (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) who use electroreception?

You will need these files in order to adequately run the code: 

1) The Jupyter Notebook
2) FASTA files for Electrophorus electricus atp1a2a, Anguilla anguilla atp1a2a, Ornithorhynchus anatinus atp1a2, Electrophorus electricus scn4aa, Anguilla anguilla scn4aa, and Ornithorhynchus anatinus scn4aa. 

The FASTA files were all obtained from NCBI's gene search. An example of the link to NCBI's link is here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/113588309. Files were downloaded as raw DNA sequences of just the gene of interest and saved as a FASTA file to be imported into Jupyter Notebook. 
The output of the code is a heatmap.
